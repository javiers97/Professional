        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            5+ years of experience helping enterprise-level, NA clients unlock value and achieve measurable outcomes through technology. I specialize in building long-term strategic partnerships, aligning software solutions with business goals to drive growth, retention, and customer satisfaction.
            <br /><br />
            With a solid background in customer experience, stakeholder management, and cross-functional collaboration, I act as the voice of the customer while ensuring internal teams stay focused on delivering real impact. I’ve led success initiatives for Fortune 500 companies and played a key role in achieving double-digit net retention growth.
            <br /><br />
            As a former Division 1 athlete, I bring a strong team mindset, resilience, and leadership under pressure—skills that translate directly into how I lead client relationships and internal collaboration. I’m also passionate about emerging technologies and continuously exploring how to use them to improve efficiency and deliver better outcomes every day.
